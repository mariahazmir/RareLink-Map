# RareLink Map

[RareLink Map](https://rarelink-map.onrender.com/rarelink/home.html) is an online tool designed to connect rare disease patients, caregivers, and supporters across Malaysia. It provides a safe, anonymous way to pin general locations, discover nearby connections, and join local support groups.

This repository contains a static export of the RareLink Map website (originally built on Squarespace) using **HTTrack**, for archival and demo purposes.
